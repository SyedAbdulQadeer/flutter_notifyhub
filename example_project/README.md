# Firebase Notification Handler - Simple Example

This is a simple Flutter example demonstrating how to use the `flutter_notifyhub` package.

## Quick Setup

1. **Replace Firebase Service Account**: 
   In `lib/main.dart`, replace the `_serviceAccount` map with your actual Firebase service account JSON.

2. **Get Your FCM Token**: 
   - Set up Firebase in your own app
   - Get the FCM token from your device
   - Paste it into the app

3. **Run the Example**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Check Service Health** - Verify the AlwariDev backend is running
2. **Enter FCM Token** - Paste your device's FCM token
3. **Enter Title & Body** - Write your notification content
4. **Send Notification** - Tap send and check your device!

## What You Need

- Your Firebase project service account JSON
- FCM token from your device
- The AlwariDev backend service running at: `https://notifyhub-eight.vercel.app`

That's it! Simple and clean example to test the package.
